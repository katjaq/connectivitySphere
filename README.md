Connectome in a Sphere.

A project with [Gael Varoquaux](https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux), [Roberto Toro](https://github.com/r03ert0) & Katja Heuer

June 2017

The functional connectome was derived from data from the ADHD 200 dataset with [nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html). We computed a group-sparse covariance matrix as in this [example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_multi_subject_connectome.html), thresholded it and projected the connectome onto a sphere. We then translated this into a 3D model built from ultra violet reactive thread. (âˆ…1m, >2km thread :D)
